# Video Game Sales Analysis
 
## Short Description
This project performs an analysis of video game sales data using Python. The analysis includes data manipulation, visualization, and exploration of sales trends across different regions and platforms.
 
## Getting Started
 
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- Recommended packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`
- Additional libraries may be required depending on specific functionality (update as needed).
 
### Installing
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Windows: env\Scripts\activate

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ## Running the Tests
 
### Breakdown of Tests
- **Unit Tests:**  
  These tests validate the individual functions responsible for data processing.
  ```bash
  pytest tests/test_data_processing.py

  ## Deployment
 
To deploy or run the analysis:
 
1. **Prepare the environment for production:**  
   Configure all necessary environment variables and settings according to your deployment environment.
 
2. **Run the main Python script or Jupyter Notebook:**
   - If using a script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - If using the notebook, open and run `Project-1.ipynb`.
 
3. **Optional: Docker Deployment**
   - **Build the Docker image:**
     ```bash
     docker build -t video-game-sales-analysis .
     ```
   - **Run the Docker container:**
     ```bash
     docker run -p 8000:8000 video-game-sales-analysis
     ```
